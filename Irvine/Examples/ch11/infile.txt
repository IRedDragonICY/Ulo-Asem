Why not write the type of graphical applications you usually see 
running under MS-Windows? The main reason is that they tend to 
be extremely long and detailed. For years, C and C++ programmers 
have labored over technical details such as graphical device handles, 
message posting, font metrics, device bitmaps, and mapping modes, 
with the help of excellent authors. In fact, there is a devoted group 
of assembly language programmers on the Web who are quite good 
at Windows programming.
