; Using PeekConsoleInput          (PeekInput.asm)

COMMENT @
This program shows how to get single key input by
calling PeekConsoleInput.
Thanks to Richard Stam for his first version of this code.

More analysis is still to be done on this topic, because the
current version does not recognize keyboard combinations such as
Ctrl-F1 or Alt-F2. The Ctrl and Shift keys are returned as separate
keystrokes in themselves. The MS-Windows virtual keycodes do not
seem to include these combinations.

ReadKey_ PROC
;
; Checks the console input buffer for a pending keystroke.
; If a key is waiting, ZF=0, the 8-bit keyboard scan code
; is returned in AH, and the key is returned in AL.
; Otherwise, ZF=1. The return values of this function are
; identical to INT 16h Function 11h, documented on page 533.
;
; Sample call:
; 	call ReadKey
; 	jz   NoKeyWaiting	; no key in buffer
;	mov  scanCode,ah
;   mov  ASCIICode,al
;
; Note: The virtual key code and virtual scan code in the
; KEY_EVENT_RECORD actually return 16-bit device-indepent
; values. But since Irvine32.lib assumes 8-bit OEM characters,
; we're just returning 8-bit values here.
